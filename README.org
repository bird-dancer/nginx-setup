* setup-nginx-certbot

A script that automaticly sets up a nginx serverblock or reverse proxy with ssl and the possibility of a git repository being directly hosted on GNU/Linux

** what it does:

+ it sets up nginx as a server block or as a reverse proxy
  + for server blocks it generates a folder scructure with a test index.html file
+ if you want to, certbot generates a new new ssl certificate which the script can include in the nginx conf file
+ if wanted, the script manages access to website via .htaccess and a username password combination
+ if you want to, a git repository will be created whose content will be hosted via nginx

** dependancies

+ nginx
+ grep
+ certbot (optional - only if you want to generate a ssl certificate)

** how to use it:
